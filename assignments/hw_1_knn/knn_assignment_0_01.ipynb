    "The kNN classifier consists of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply remembers it\n",
    "- During testing, kNN classifies every test image by comparing to all training images and transfering the labels of the k most similar training examples\n",
    "- The value of k is cross-validated\n",
